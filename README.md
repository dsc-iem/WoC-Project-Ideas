## Fake-Stream

* *Project link:* https://github.com/Nibba2018/Fake-Stream
* *Mentors:* [Soham Biswas](https://github.com/Nibba2018)

>Allows infinite streaming of a video as webcam output for different applications like Zoom, Skype etc.

**Description:** `v4l2loopback` is a kernel module which allows the creation of virtual webcams on a device running the linux kernel. The objective of `Fake-Stream` is to provide an easy to use API/SDK to modify or alter the webcam data being streamed towards that virtual camera. `FFMPEG` will be used to encode and decode such frames.

### Project Ideas
  1. **Adding audio support and generic QoL improvements:**
   So far fake stream supports video only. We would like to have the feature of streaming audio as well. Streaming of audio can be done along with the video or as a separate utility. Once audio is implemented, some Quality of Life improvements are also required(Specific details can be discussed).

      * Tech Stack: ALSA, FFMPEG and BASH.

  2. **Adding Windows Support:** Currently fake stream is available on linux only as `v4l2loopback` is a linux specific kernel module. But a work-around can be achieved using OBS virtual cams. The objective of this project would be to refactor the code to run on windows(as a separate script or as a cross platform script).

      * Tech Stack: OBS Documentation and Batch Scripting.

  3. **Adding SDK for Python or C:** Fake stream is implemented in OS specific shell scripts. Having a simple SDK will allow users to simply import fake-stream and integrate it with their own scripts or programs. For now one can work on creating sdks for Linux only.

      * Tech Stack: FFMPEG libraries for C and Python.
